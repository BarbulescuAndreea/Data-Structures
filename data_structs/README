I  created the helper functions: create, insert in a node type list, stack functions, then
visitNR, a function that I modified so that it checks if it exists in a graph
cycles or is acyclic. Then in hand for requirement 1, I added the corresponding nodes to the grap,
I formed the graph, then I checked if it is cyclic or acyclic.
